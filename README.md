## Note
One or more of these four scripts were functioning when I wrote this code back in class 11 (2020). I am sorry, I don't have the time or incentive to check which one. Also, anyone intending to use these scripts has to modify them significantly to work as per their need, because I wrote these quickly and lazily when I didn't want to attend any online school classes :)

## How It Works
The scripts use the Selenium WebDriver to interact with the Teams web application in a Chrome browser. The WebDriver can find elements on the web page, click buttons, fill in text fields, and more.  

The scripts follow a schedule defined by a set of start and end times for different subjects (Physics, Computer Science, English, Chemistry, and Maths). When run, the scripts will wait until the start time of the next subject, then find and join the corresponding meeting on Teams.
